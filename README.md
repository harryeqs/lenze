# üîç **Lenze:** A search engine inspired by Perplexity AI.

## Features
Lenze is capable of doing:
- Search on web on user's query.
- Retrive summarised information regarding the query.
- Provide sources to each piece of information.
- Suggest relevant queries.

## Framework
Lenze utilises the [Netmind.AI-XYZ](https://github.com/protagolabs/Netmind-AI-XYZ) framework to manipulate multiple agents.

## Agents
Lenze consists of the following agents:

**Analysis Agent:** Analyze the query input from the user and break down a complex query into simpler sub-queries if necessary.

**Search Agent:** Search across the internet on a list of given sub-queries and return a list of sources containing URLs and text content at the URLs.
<br>There are two sub-agents that this agent calls:
- **Optimization Agent:** Optimize the query for most accurate Google search results.
- **Refining Agent:** Refined the search results to exclude irrelevant, redundant and unreliable sources.

**Response Agent:** Analyze the extracted information and generate a concise response to user's query and generate related queries.

## Workflow
```mermaid
graph TB;
    A[User inputs query] --> B[Agent Analyzes query and break it down into sub-queries]
    B --> C[Agent optimizes sub-query]
    C --> D[Search online using the optimized query]
    D --> E[Scrape text from sites in search results to produce sources]
    E --> F[Generate embeddings for each source]
    F --> G{More sub-queries?}
    G -- Yes --> C
    G -- No --> H[Find the most relevant sources by comparing embeddings of query to sources]
    H --> I[Agent analyzes sources and generate response]
    I --> J[Agent suggests relevant queries]
```

## Getting Started
To get started, please create an ```.env``` file in the main directory of this repo.
<br>In the ```.env``` file, please insert the OpenAI API key, Google API key and your Google Custom Search Engine ID as below:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = Your-OpenAI-API-Key
